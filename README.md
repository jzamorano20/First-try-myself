# Description
## started off with working code

*  I had to create a new Repo on Github and clone it on my terminal 
*  After which I had to fix parts of the HTML code with proper semantics so it would be SEO friendly
*  Change the Style.css sheet so that my changes in the HTML would be match up and not effect the outcome of the project. while also added notes to what changes i made to HTML and the CSS.
*  alot of condensing was done to cut out unnecessary "created classes"
*  upload the work site to Github and make a working link on Gitpages to open it up on the web.

## Usage
